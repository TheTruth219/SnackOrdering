This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## NAT Notes
* I moved the server dependencies to the main package.json, and changed the port to 4000. 
* I tried to use HOC Error-Handling to manage 503 responses, but did not have time to test.
* I made some cors adjustments on server while troubleshooting. They may or may not be necessary...
* I've had issues with the package.json running both servers on my Windows machine. It's runs perfectly on my Mac. Haven't had time to troubleshoot, but I may have something installed globally on my mac that may be responsible.


## Thank You
